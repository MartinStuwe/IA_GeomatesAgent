(clear-all)

;;; in the agent, arbitrary helper functions may be defined
;;; using Common Lisp, but also all add-ons of the SBCL lisp
;;; system, in particular loading shared libraries and calling
;;; functions in those libraries.
;;; For details, see SBCL manual regarding its alien function interace
;;; or have a look into geomates.lisp which connects to a C library
;;;
;;; Additionally, you can use run-program to call any external software.
;;; Note that the process will be run in a null environment by default, so
;;; all pathnames must be explicit. To handle different locations, a simple
;;; "or" may be all it takes:

(defparameter *my-ls* (or (probe-file "/bin/ls")
			  (probe-file "/usr/bin/ls")
			  (probe-file "some/path"))
  "binds to the first file that exists")

(defun count-entries ()
  "counts the number of files/directories in the root directory"
  (count #\Newline ; just count linebreaks since after printing a name, ls prints a newline
	 (with-output-to-string (result) ; temporary string output stream
	   (run-program (probe-file "/bin/ls") (list "/") :output result))))
